    "Consider the domain shown in the figure below which has $N_x$ grids in the $x$-direction and $N_y$ grids in the $y$-direction, or a total of $N = N_x \\times N_y$ grids. The grids are numbered from $k = 0$ to $k = N - 1$, starting ($k = 0$) from the bottom-left corner and finishing ($k = N - 1$) at the top-right corner. Grids are considered connected if they are neighbors, i.e. adjacent to each other. In general $N_x$ does not equal to $N_y$ (although they could be equal).\n",

    "For example in the figure, $N_x=4$ and $N_y=3$ (therefore $N=12$). Grid $k=5$ has $4$ neighbors: $k = 4$ (left), $k = 6$ (right), $k = 1$ (bottom), and $k = 9$ (top). In fact, all interior grids have 4 neighbors. However, grids on the edges have only 2 or 3 neighbors. For example, grid $k = 3$ is only neighbors with $k = 2$ (left) and $k = 7$ (top). It has no neighbor to the right ($k = 4$ is NOT its neighbor) or bottom.\n",

    "In reservoir simulation, we often use similar grid systems to solve for pressures, saturations, etc. in the reservoir. To do so we map the grid onto an $N \\times N$ matrix (called $\\mathbf{A}$), where each $k$ grid represents a row in the matrix. Most of the elements of the matrix are zero (so it is a *sparse* matrix). But an element of the matrix is equal to $-1$ if the matrix row and column for that element are neighbors in the original grid system. For the main diagonal terms (i.e. row $k$, column $k$), it is equal to the total number of neighbors grid $k$ has.\n",

In the corresponding matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, $A_{5 4}=A_{5 6}=A_{5 1}=A_{5 9}= -1$. $A_{5 5} = 4$ because gridblock 5 has 4 neighbors. Likewise, $A_{3 2} = A_{3 7} = -1$, but $A_{3 4} = 0$ since grids 3 and 4 are not neighbors. $A_{3 3} = 2$ because grid 3 has 2 neighbors...
